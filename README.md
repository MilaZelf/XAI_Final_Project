# XAI_Final_Project
This project contains code for the final project for the course Explainable AI
The code was originally created and run in google colab. Running the code was only tested there, so running the code elsewhere might require extra steps.

## Setup
1. Open the notebook in google colab
2. In the toolbar, select runtime > change runtime type and select one of the available GPUs under hardwareaccelerator
3. The code is now ready to execute
